                  </a>, I supported pharma, biotech, and healthcare clients navigating reputation, regulation, and growth. Those years taught me how organizations behave under pressure, how stakeholders actually make decisions, and how easily good ideas fail without structure, governance, and follow-through.

                  </a>, I worked during a particularly formative period for the genomics industry. The company was scaling rapidly, the science was advancing quickly, and expectations for corporate leadership were rising alongside it. That environment sharpened my thinking around category leadership, credibility, and the long-term nature of corporate reputation.
